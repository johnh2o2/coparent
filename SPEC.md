Co-parenting app
================

This is an iPhone app that makes it convenient and easy to set and define coparenting schedules at *15 minute granularity* designed to account for situations where handovers are frequent (e.g. in the morning and in the evening, and also to account for time that no parenting took place, e.g. nanny was here).

We would also like to _plan_ and _edit_ scehdules, with notes that can be tagged to a day and possibly a time.

Additionally, the ability to have different messaging threads for communication would be useful as well.

Ideally we would track a running log of total care hours for both parties.

Finally, it would be good to hook this up to an API maybe anthropic or OpenAI or something that can take e.g. a voice command or a flag in a message and adjust a schedule easily ("hey can you pick her up at 8:15 today instead?" ==> changed care log)

We would need to define a plan to make this useable for a small group (we're not planning to e.g. create a scaled product); we need reliable and private data storage, we need a non-buggy interface, we need a pleasant and easy to use UI.
